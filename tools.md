title="TheRec"
description="TheRec is a free and open-source recording software for Windows 7+. Currently TheRec does not offer all features that a regular capture agent provides, as it does not support scheduling and uploading from Opencast. For an automated upload it relies on MHRI. Unlike other recording tools TheRec is easy to install and to configure. It supports a wide variety of capture cards that are compatible with Microsoft DirectShow. The number of simultaneous streams that can be recorded is only limited by the speed of the computer.

# Security

{% include fullsizebox.html
title="Opencast Stream Security Plugins"
description="Opencast supports URL signing to provide additional protection of resources against unauthorised access. While the Opencast core provides both facilities to sign URLs and verify signed URLs, additional efforts are required in setups that take advantage of dedicated download and/or streaming servers. Such dedicated distribution servers need to be capable to at least verify signed URLs to offer the same level of protection for distribution artefacts they are providing access to.

Currently, there are two Opencast Stream Security plugins available:

- [Apache HTTP Stream Security Plugin](https://bitbucket.org/opencast-community/apache-httpd-stream-security-plugin)
- [Wowza Stream Security Plugin](https://bitbucket.org/opencast-community/wowza-stream-security-plugin/src)"

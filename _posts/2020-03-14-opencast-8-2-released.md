# Opencast 8.2: Release Notes

Usually Opencast maintenance releases do not contain any new features, but we decided to make an exception in this release.
As several universities worldwide face shutdowns in these days because
of the Corona virus, we have the feeling that a web-based recording tool like Opencast Studio could help several
Opencast users to deal with the current situation. That is why we decided to include this new feature into
Opencast 8.2 that has been released today

The Opencast codebase is located on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencast/opencast).

A full list of changes can be found in the [official release notes](https://docs.opencast.org/r/8.x/admin/releasenotes/).

Visit the [installation guide](https://docs.opencast.org/r/8.x/admin/installation/) for more information on how to get Opencast 8.

# Opencast Dev'n'Hack Camp

Are you interested in adding features to Opencast? Do you want to build your
own capture agent? Still looking for that Wordpress integration? Let us know!

Join us for a two-day Opencast Dev'n'Hack Camp between the Free and Open-source
Software Developers' European Meeting (FOSDEM) and the 2020 Opencast Summit in
Ghent, Belgium.

The camp allows developers and technical enthusiasts to discuss ideas and to
collaboratively implement cool hacks and new features around the Opencast
project. Hardware builds, extensions, new features, integration, bring your
idea and try. No idea? Come anyway and help someone else to realize their idea.

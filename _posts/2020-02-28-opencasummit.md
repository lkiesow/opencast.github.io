We had the most wonderful time in Gent, Belgium during the 2020 community summit. With a lower turnout than usual, 55 people heard about latest developments in the Opencast community, discussed current issues and future developments. Newly added keynotes were received well as part of the conference mix featuring schedule talks, ad hoc meetings and plenty of opportunities to simply talk in person.

Thanks to our hosts from Gent university!

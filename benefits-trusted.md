## Driven by innovators. Sustained by a community

Opencast is closely linked with **UC Berkeley** and **ETH Zurich** as its founding institutions. But many other institutions have joined their effort and broadened the profile of Opencast: **Osnabr√ºck University** with its focus on the engage end, providing for the standard video player. The **University of Valencia** offering the Paella Player as an alternative. **Harvard DCE** using that player to support their distance education programme with an emphasis on robustness, reliability, and performance in global distribution. Plus the **University of Manchester**, taking Opencast to another level with 300 plus lecture halls producing hundreds of video assets each day. The Swiss academic network provider SWITCH is offering Opencast-based video management services to its member universities. And there is **community of institutions** and individuals using the system, supporting its further development not only with feedback, but with initiatives to (collectively) build additional features.

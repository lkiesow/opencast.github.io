# [Try it!](https://stable.opencast.org/)

Want to try Opencast for yourself?  We host a free, fully functional demonstration system with pre-processed media so
you can experience the Opencast user interface as both an administrator and end-user without having to download,
install, or configure Opencast yourself.  Feel free to upload your own media as well, because the system is reset
and rebuilt nightly.  The credentials for an admin user are *admin* / *opencast*.

# [Install it!](https://docs.opencast.org/r/5.x/admin/installation/)
Want to run Opencast locally?  Opencast runs on Linux or MacOS servers. There are repositories with binaries available for CentOS (RPM) and Debian (DEB) like distributions. There are also Docker images available. If none of this works for you, you also download the [raw binaries](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/releases), or use our detailed guide on how to build [Opencast from source](https://github.com/opencast/opencast) yourself.

Join the [mailing lists](communication.md) and see for yourself.<br><br>__Attend a community event__<br>Our conferences are hosted annually in January or February, and are the perfect place to meet community memebers running Opencast in production.  All of our adopters are welcome to present, meaning you will see everything from tiny institutions with a one or two rooms, to large 100+ room environemnts.<br><br>__Run an Opencast pilot__<br>Work with the community, or a [commercial support partner](support.md) to set up a low-risk Opencast pilot.  Opencast can even be run in parallel with any legacy lecture capture platform you have installed.

Our committer group has the final say in technical decisions, and joining it is the best way to get your opinions heard in the project!<br>|
|Institutional leadership<br><br>IT leadership<br><br>Capture selection committee leadership|__Try multiple platforms including Opencast__<br>Encourage your institution to try Opencast and other lecture capture options to help determine which provide the best fit for your needs, strategy, and future direction.  There is no substitute for hands-on experience, so download the software and run a pilot for your campus.<br><br>__Invest sufficient time and attention to the evaluation process__<br>Give your staff the resources and time necessary to explore your lecture capture options.  Short-changing this evaluation process often leads to sub-optimal solutions.<br><br>__Engage with the Opencast community during your evaluation process__<br>You are not the first to go through this process, and other institutions who have engaged with Opencast have experienced more successful deployments in their final selections.  Both our community, and our commercial partners are here to help you get started, and keep going when you experience issues.<br><br>__Explore our [user stories](users.md)__<br>Our best advertisements are our users, many of whom have significantly reduced both their licensing, and operational costs using Opencast.  Take a look at our [user stories](users.md) to see how Opencast is being used successfully all over the globe.|

# Opencast Deployment Models
Opencast is highly scalable, and is deployed at both small, and massive scale around the world.  Opencast is also
highly flexible:  You can deploy Opencast on premesis, or in the cloud, or even create a hybrid system with both.
There are no licensing costs, so starting small and extending your installation is very common within the community.
Opencast has many deployment models, including:

 - __Deploy and support Opencast yourself__: Deploy Opencast on your own and draw on the support of our active community.
 - __Deploy Opencast yourself and purchase commercial support__: Install and deploy Opencast on your own and contract with one of our [commercial support providers](support.md).
 - __Deploy Opencast with commercial support__: Contract with a [commercial support provider](support.md) to help you install and deploy Opencast.

# Financial Planning for an Opencast Deployment
Because Opencast has no license code, Opencast requires a different approach compared to other, proprietary solutions.
Extending Opencast to more of your users does not incur any incremental licensing costs.

Adopting institutions must plan for in-room hardware and other infrastructure costs, as well as the staff, and time
required to set up and maintain Opencast, whether these things are handled in-house, or by an external provider.
Adopter institutions are also encouraged to join the [Apereo Foundation](http://apereo.org) and contribute modest
annual membership fees to sustain the Opencast project. These fees provide for technical and community coordination and
enable Apereo to be a safe haven for open source software and licensing.

## Individual contributors
You can download, install, and use Opencast without telling anyone, no problem. However, by telling people you did, by describing your setup on [list](https://opencast.org/communication), or telling people about the challenges you faced, you are already contributing to the community. Because others can benefit from your experience. 

The opportunities to support the community grow with your experience: File bugs, help people on list, prepare the next release by testing the latest version. Or take care of the wiki, the website, and inform your respective community about Opencast. It's almost impossible not to contribute.

## Institutional contributors
Institutions using Opencast usually decide what their employees can do with respect to the software; by allowing them to become contributors or committers themselves, you are giving back to the community. By joining our meetings and sharing your plans,
you are building the Opencast networks the software relies upon.

## Institutional supporters: Opencast funding scheme, Apereo membership
The more your institutions benefits from Opencast, the more you should be involved in the product development and the community, host an event or a server the community benefits from.

Once you are successfully providing services with Opencast, think about supporting us by joining the [Apereo foundation](http://apereo.org/): 
Membership with our umbrella organisation is an "Opencast Supporting Subscription" that provides us with financial resources to strengthen the community, further develop the product or solve specific issues - funding institutions collectively decide what the membership fees should be invested in. 

Membership fees are flexible towards smaller organisational units and specific contexts. If you want to find out more about the [Apereo membership](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership), please contact the [board](mailto:schulte@id.ethz.ch).

## Committers
Committers are actively coding towards Opencast or contributing to its further development in other forms. 
They are the body driving the product according to the projects [governance](https://opencast.org/governance.html) and their status is 
[meritocratic](https://docs.opencast.org/develop/developer/committer/).

## Sponsors
Companies relying on Opencast for their commercial offerings can sponsor the project in a [variety of ways](assets/img/opencast_sponsorship_programme.pdf). If you would like to learn more about our sponsorship programme, feel free to [contact us](mailto:schulte@id.ethz.ch).

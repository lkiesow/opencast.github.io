Confused about which release to start with?  We support the latest two major releases, with other major releases
supported by the community via the mailing list.  If you are just starting out, choose the release with the latest
end of support time to ensure that your install does not immediately need upgrading!

We release twice per year, once in December and once in June.  These releases are major releases with new features
and likely require administrative time to install and update.  Minor patch releases can come at any time, and contain
only bug fixes and performance improvements.  These releases should be drop in replacements and should require minimal
upgrade time.
